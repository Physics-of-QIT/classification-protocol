# Quantum Machine Learning Classification Protocol

This repository contains the core implementation for the quantum machine learning classification protocol described in our paper:

**ðŸ“„ Paper**: [Enhanced image classification via hybridizing quantum dynamics with classical neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13587)

## Installation

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Physics-of-QIT/classification-protocol.git
cd classification-protocol
```

### Data Directory Setup

The framework expects certain directories to exist:

```bash
mkdir -p data logs dataset src/figures
```

- `data/`: Stores experimental results and model outputs
- `logs/`: Contains training and execution logs  
- `dataset/`: Custom dataset storage
- `src/figures/`: Generated plots and visualizations
